## Description of Group
A vegan potluck club for anyone interested in cooking and eating vegan food!
Vegan food is defined as food that contains no animals, insects, or their 
by-products. Meat, fish, gelatin, milk, eggs, cheese, butter, yogurt, and 
honey are not vegan. Beans, grains, vegetables, fruits, tofu, tempeh, and 
vegan alternatives to milk, cheese, yogurt, and butter are vegan. If anyone 
wants to participate but is unfamiliar with cooking vegan food, I am happy to 
refer people to my favorite websites for vegan recipes.

## Dates and Times of Four Meetings (January â€“ April)
2nd Saturdays of the month. 

Time by agreement of participants

- 1st meeting January 14
- 2nd meeting February 11 
- 3rd meeting  March 11
- 4th meeting  April 8

## Location
In-person! Seeking participant volunteers to open their homes to meet. 
Unfortunately, my apartment is too small to comfortably host.

## Maximum and Minimum Number of Participants
- Max: 8
- Min: 4

## Additional Information
Participants are expected to avoid high-transmission 
activities (like concerts, indoor bars, and indoor dining) in the week prior 
to the gathering and to self-test for COVID-19 on the day of the gathering 
to lower our risk of transmitting COVID-19 to one another. If someone tests 
positive for COVID-19 and cannot come, I or another volunteer will make up a 
take-away plate from the gathering and deliver it to their home if they want 
to eat it, because I don't want anyone totally left out if they can't come.
