## Description of Group

Participants will have opportunities to practice skills in deep listening and 
asking evoking questions, practices which assume that each person has a direct 
inward connection with God, Spirit, Christ and/or the Inner Guide. A 
faithfulness group is a small group focused on helping one another discern and 
respond to how the Spirit is leading/calling each of us in our lives. In the 
structured format, two people have about an hour of focus each time the group 
meets, rotating among the members so that all have a turn. The focus person 
gives a 15-minute presentation about the area of their life or leading or 
ministry they would like to focus on. Then the group asks questions to help 
the person explore this in a deeper way. There will also be an introductory 
workshop to faithfulness groups on November 19th if you're curious to learn 
more first!
