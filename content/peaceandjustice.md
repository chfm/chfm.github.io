## Minutes

### Minute from Peace & Justice Committee (October 15, 2020)

American democracy is in peril. For the first time in our history, we have a
President refusing to commit to a peaceful transfer of power should he lose the
election. This is the time, not to agonize, but to organize. Some Friends have
begun non-violent efforts that are reflected on
[https://choosedemocracy.us](https://choosedemocracy.us). We support those
efforts and invite Friends, as they are moved, to visit this website, take the
pledge thereon proposed and attend some of the training sessions listed there.
We pray we will not need to prepare.  But if we fail to plan, we plan to fail.
