# Covid Safety

In addition, with much discernment over many months, the Ministry & Worship
committee is in unity in recommending that masks become optional at future
meetings for worship, beginning either in the last week of November or first
week of December as determined by this Meeting for Worship with Attention to
Business. Masks would be optional in both the Meeting room and the school
house. We acknowledge that risk may be higher in the foyer and library until
the ventilation project is completed. Friends are reminded to stay home if
they are not feeling well and join worship via Zoom.


The sense of the meeting became that we are ready to move forward with masks
optional, even knowing that this may not be the personal preference of all,
and several Friends decided to not let their worry stand in the way. Friends
came to unity despite personal reservations.
