# Our Community

Chapel Hill Friends Meeting was established in 1937. We are a member of the
Piedmont Friends Yearly Meeting. We are an unprogrammed meeting without clergy.
We share responsibility for what happens in the Meeting. Ongoing activities are
for the most part carried out by committee.

Four of our members serve on the Board of the Carolina Friends School, which
was started in 1964 by members of the Durham and Chapel Hill Meetings. One of
the three Carolina Friends Early Schools (pre-school) is housed in our building.
In addition, we helped to start and support the counseling work of Quaker House
in Fayetteville, primarily for armed service personnel at Fort Bragg and Camp
Lejeune.
