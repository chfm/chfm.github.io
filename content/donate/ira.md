# Give From an IRA
If you are 70½ or older the IRS allows you to give to charitable
organizations, including CHFM, directly from an IRA and pay no
income tax on the distribution—even if you don’t itemize
deductions. For a detailed discussion of this and other
tax-advantaged methods of donating, see these resources:
