## Eyes Ears Nose and Paws

Eyes Ears Nose and Paws is a nonprofit organization located in Chapel Hill/Carrboro, North Carolina. We train and place Mobility Assistance and Medical Alert Dogs as well as provide ongoing support to working Assistance Dog Teams that have graduated through our programs. We are accredited members of Assistance Dogs International, a worldwide coalition of nonprofit programs that train and place Assistance Dogs. We believe learning and service happen at both ends of the leash, so we work in partnership with the correctional system to teach inmates to train assistance dogs that we partner with people who have disabilities. This is a triple win: our dogs get full-time attention, training, and love; the inmate-trainers develop interpersonal, leadership, and job skills while giving back to the community despite their incarceration; and our clients receive life-changing support for their disabilities in the form of a highly-trained canine partner.

More than 1 million members, supporters, and valued partners have helped us plant more than 350 million trees in neighborhoods, communities, cities, and forests throughout the world to ensure a greener and healthier future for everyone.

## Haw River Assembly

The Haw River Assembly is a 501(c)(3) non-profit citizens’ group founded in 1982 to restore and protect the Haw River and Jordan Lake, and to build a watershed community that shares this vision. Our goals are to promote environmental education, conservation and pollution prevention; to speak as a voice for the river in the public arena; and to put into peoples’ hands the tools and the knowledge they need to be effective guardians of the river.  The scenic 110 mile Haw River is at the headwaters of the Cape Fear River Basin, and includes the Jordan Lake reservoir, providing drinking water and recreation to NC. Tributaries of the Haw River and Jordan Lake flow through Guilford, Rockingham, Caswell, Alamance, Orange, Chatham, Wake and Durham counties. Almost one million people are part of this watershed–sedimentation, wastewater, and runoff impair its waters.
