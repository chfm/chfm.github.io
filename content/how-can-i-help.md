# How Can I Help Against Racism?

## Informing Ourselves

Informing ourselves the origins and effects of racism helps.  A good reading
list: [https://time.com/5846732/books-to-read-about-anti-racism/](https://time.com/5846732/books-to-read-about-anti-racism/) and a
comprehensive syllabus of material to read, listen and watch online can be seen

## Reflection Points and Action

- Be more than "not racist"; be antiracist. [https://bit.ly/what-is-antiracist](https://bit.ly/what-is-antiracist)
- Have difficult conversations. Do you know someone who: Feels angry when people
  tell them that they benefit from white privilege? Says “Not all white people”
  or similar phrases? Tries convincing you that you are wrong by pointing out
  people of color who agree with their views? Talks about when they immigrated,
  or explains their own hardships when a PoC talks about being oppressed? Feels
  the need to state that they have friends/family who are people of color? These
  comments may seem well-meaning but help build an uncritical defense of racism
  -- engage and challenge these views. Talking with friends and family:
