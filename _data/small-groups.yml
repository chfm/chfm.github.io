    **ONGOING and OPEN small group**

    We meet almost every Thursday night around 7:00 via zoom for some brief
    chatting, followed by game-playing on
    <a href="https://en.boardgamearena.com/">boardgamearena.com</a>.
    We often start
    with the quick spaghetti-Western social deduction game Bang! and the quick
    strategy civilization-building card game Seven Wonders, but we have played
    10 to 20 different games over the course of the pandemic, depending on who
    is attending. Showing up later works, too, but you might spend some of
    your time watching and chatting instead of playing.

    **ONGOING and OPEN**  

    We meet for about 90 minutes for a worship sharing or Claremont Dialogue on
    two topics. ALL CONVERSATION IS IN SPANISH. These groups are based on
    listening. Individuals have time to share without interruption or dialogue.
    The first topic is sharing how our lives have been for the last month. The
    second topic is a query, most commonly the same query the Meeting is using
    for the month. We generally meet online, but sometimes we meet at Friends'
    homes for an optional informal potluck first.

    Come join a small group of Friends as we explore four local hiking trails
    in late winter, early spring and get to know more about the habitat and
    each other on the trails. Each hike is between 4-5 miles on uneven ground,
    some with hills. Children and dogs are welcome (though no dogs are allowed
    on the Mason Farm hike.) Note that Peter will be glad to answer any question
    about nature but the focus will be on getting to know each other.
- name: Introduction to Faithfulness Groups
  facilitator: Campo Larrick
  tag: "faithfulness"
  content: >
    Participants will have opportunities to practice skills in deep listening and
    asking evoking questions, practices which assume that each person has a direct
    inward connection with God, Spirit, Christ and/or the Inner Guide. A
    faithfulness group is a small group focused on helping one another discern and
    respond to how the Spirit is leading/calling each of us in our lives. In the
    structured format, two people have about an hour of focus each time the group
    meets, rotating among the members so that all have a turn. The focus person
    gives a 15-minute presentation about the area of their life or leading or
    ministry they would like to focus on. Then the group asks questions to help
    the person explore this in a deeper way. There will also be an introductory
    workshop to faithfulness groups on November 19th if you're curious to learn
    more first!

    A vegan potluck club for anyone interested in cooking and eating vegan food!
    Vegan food is defined as food that contains no animals, insects, or their
    by-products. Meat, fish, gelatin, milk, eggs, cheese, butter, yogurt, and
    honey are not vegan. Beans, grains, vegetables, fruits, tofu, tempeh, and
    vegan alternatives to milk, cheese, yogurt, and butter are vegan. If anyone
    wants to participate but is unfamiliar with cooking vegan food, I am happy to
    refer people to my favorite websites for vegan recipes.
