  title: "F/friends in Unlikely Places: Engaging Those Who Disagree"
  description: >
    Does talking to friends, family, and legislators who don't agree with you
    feel like an exercise in futility? In this workshop, we'll make the case
    for engaging people with differing views and discuss how to have those
    conversations faithfully and effectively. Drawing on theoretical,
    strategic, and spiritual frameworks from Quaker tradition, this workshop
    will equip F/friends with new skills for communicating across political
    divides, practicing seeing that of God in people we disagree with, and
    building relationships to make change in our communities and in Congress.

    Facilitator: Bobby Trice, FCNL Quaker engagement program manager. In this
    role, he cultivates relationships with Friends and coordinates FCNL staff
    and volunteer engagement with Quaker communities across the country. Bobby
    is passionate about supporting Quakers' spirit-led advocacy, communicating
    across political divides, and building relationships to make change within
    and beyond Congress. Bobby is a member of Friends Meeting of Washington
    (Baltimore Yearly Meeting).
