  title: > Quaker Public Ministry: Defiance, Lament, and Repair
  description > 
    Windy Cooler shares: The presentation will draw from my and Christy's Friends Journal article and my work 
    with the Friends Incubator for Public Ministry. We’ll explore the tension between 
    Quakers as prophetic challengers of the status quo and Quakers as participants 
    in conformity and colonizing systems. I’ll be asking: 
    *What does it mean to revive any aspect of Quakerism given our complicated history?* 
    *Do we even know our complicated history?*
    The session will highlight figures such as George Fox, Margaret Fell, Benjamin Lay, 
    John Woolman, Elizabeth Fry, and Bayard Rustin, and it will open conversation about how
    meetings today respond when prophetic voices arise in our midst.
