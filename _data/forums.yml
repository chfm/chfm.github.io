    North Carolina Yearly Meeting and Slavery, 1755-1845 with David Haines
  description: >
    David Haines is a member of Durham Friends Meeting and author on 18th century 
    Quakerism. Quakers participated in the slave trade in America from the beginning of 
    the colonial period. How did North Carolina Quakers evolve from a community 
    in which its leaders were predominantly enslavers, to a community known for 
    its anti-slavery agitation? The pathway was not linear, and often involved 
    moral compromise. This talk is based largely on the minutes and other 
    writings of North Carolina Yearly Meeting.
