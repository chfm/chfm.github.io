    Karen Porter, member of the Friends House Moscow international board, last
    spoke to the meeting (pre-Ukraine War) about the history and programs of
    Friends House Moscow. This time, she will present slides and discussion of
    how Friends House is coping in this time of war in Ukraine. The slides,
    prepared by an American art historian on the board, will give a glimpse
