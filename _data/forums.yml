  title:       "Reentry House Plus"
  description: >
    Until a few months ago, Hillsborough had no housing options for those returning from
    prison. That recently changed when a group of concerned citizens formed a non-profit 
    organization and bought a house. Well located close to a bus route and a supermarket, 
    the house is called ReentryHouse Plus. The word “Plus” signifies that ReentryHouse
    Plus helps their residents overcome barriers and succeed. Doug Peterson, William 
    Elmore, Tommy Green, and Ran Hammer will describe the evolution of ReentryHouse Plus, 
    the Success While in Transition Program (SWIT), and how to invest in the success of 
    Reeentry House Plus.
