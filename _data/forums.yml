  title: "Benjamin Lay, Quaker Abolitionist"
  description: >
    Benjamin Lay (1677-1759; British, Barbadian, American Quaker) was an
    uncompromising and vocal anti-slavery pioneer. Quakers disowned him -
    more than once - and it wasn't until 2017, that he was “reclaimed.” We
    will reflect on what his life and truth teach us about Quakerism. Tom
    McQuiston.
