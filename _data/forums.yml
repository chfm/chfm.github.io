    Quaker Public Ministry: Defiance, Lament, and Repair
  description: >
    Windy Cooler: The presentation will draw from my and Christy’s Friends Journal
    article and my work with the Friends Incubator for Public Ministry.

    and Quakers as participants in conformity and colonizing systems.

    *Do we even know our complicated history?*
