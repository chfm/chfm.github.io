    The Adult Religious Education committee nurtures the spiritual growth of the
    adults in the Meeting by developing programs, workshops, classes, retreats,
    and other activities that address their spiritual needs. One of the main
    functions of this committee is the planning and implementation of weekly
    Forums, between early and late meetings. When a committee, group, or
    individual wishes to present a forum ARE asks for an outline of the
    presentation that illuminates what aspects of Quaker faith and practice will
    come forth at the forum. This often involves some reference to what
    spiritual leanings arose to direct the work the presenter is involved in and
    how this manifests in daily life. The forum outline would also make clear
    how participants will be able to engage in active dialogue with each other
    and/or the presenters. Finally giving forums a title that captures its
    essence is very helpful. Having these elements in place guides ARE in
    ensuring that the experience participants have at forums will be rich and
    meaningful.

    The Mary and Claude Shotts Memorial Fund (est.1973) is an endowment from the
    Shotts family, the annual interest from which provides financial support to
    enrich and develop the lives of individuals with a relationship to the
    Chapel Hill Friends Meeting. These opportunities include education,
    training, and service. The Leadership Development fund (est.1982), funded
    annually through an allocation from the meeting's operating budget, provides
    financial support to benefit the spiritual life of the Meeting through the
    enhancement of leadership capabilities in individuals. This includes
    Leadership Development Funds being made available to standing committees of
    the meeting in support of programming that furthers the spiritual and
    leadership development of the meeting as a whole.
    
    Although these two funds originate from separate sources, the available
    funds are combined into one account from which grants are made. These funds
    are not need-based. Since we receive requests any time and want to be able
    to respond quickly so that those requesting assistance can make their plans
    accordingly, we make the grants from whichever fund has sufficient account
    balance to cover the grant with some money remaining in that fund. Grants
    are awarded through discernment of applications by members appointed to this
    committee. 
    
    Members and attenders of the Meeting are strongly encouraged to consider
    applying for funding support from the Shotts Memorial and Leadership
    Development funds. These are YOUR funds. Friends are welcome to talk with
    committee members ahead of time to explore the viability of their request.
    If you are interested in applying for assistance from these funds, email the
    Committee at: <a href="mailto:shottsleadershipfunds@chapelhillfriends.org">
