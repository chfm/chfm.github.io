    The Adult Religious Education committee nurtures the spiritual growth of the
    adults in the Meeting by developing programs, workshops, classes, retreats,
    and other activities that address their spiritual needs. One of the main
    functions of this committee is the planning and implementation of weekly
    Forums, between early and late meetings. When a committee, group, or
    individual wishes to present a forum ARE asks for an outline of the
    presentation that illuminates what aspects of Quaker faith and practice will
    come forth at the forum. This often involves some reference to what
    spiritual leanings arose to direct the work the presenter is involved in and
    how this manifests in daily life. The forum outline would also make clear
    how participants will be able to engage in active dialogue with each other
    and/or the presenters. Finally giving forums a title that captures its
    essence is very helpful. Having these elements in place guides ARE in
    ensuring that the experience participants have at forums will be rich and
    meaningful.
