    The Chapel Hill Friends Meeting joyfully embraces the full spectrum of the Light Within, made visible through the participation of people of all beliefs, cultures, backgrounds, abilities, ethnicities, races, sexual orientations, and gender identities. Quakers, also known as members of the Religious Society of Friends, are a community of people who gather on Sunday mornings to worship in silent expectation to wait upon the spirit. We have no formal creed, no ritual, or liturgy.

    We believe that God is present in every person and the Light Within can lead us toward God's will. The Religious Society of Friends has a long history of spiritually-based activism. We are guided by communal testimonies of simplicity, peace, integrity, community, equality, and service. We believe that Truth is continuously revealed and that everyone may have a direct experience with God. Our lives speak our faith in action.

    ## Branches of Quakerism

    There are multiple branches of Quakerism, such as evangelical, conservative, pastoral and liberal. The Chapel Hill Friends Meeting indentifies itself as liberal. Liberal Friends emphasize the authority of the Inward Light which guides each of us in our lives and is our direct and immediate experience of the Divine.

    Our Meeting is also unprogrammed. That means we have no minister and no set service - no sermon, doxology or choir. There is an old saying "that we have no laity, because we are all ministers."

    Meeting for Worship is the heart of our Quaker community. The Chapel Hill Friends Meeting is of the Quaker unprogrammed tradition, meaning that we gather in silence and "expectant waiting for divine guidance", without clergy or liturgy. Together we nurture a living silence, with quiet minds and open hearts, creating a space within ourselves for spiritual revelation.

    A Quaker meeting is a local worshiping community. Most meetings have few paid workers; the Chapel Hill Friends Meeting employs a First Day School (Sunday School) Coordinator and a Child Care Provider. Quaker meetings follow the guidance of the Spirit in business as well as in worship.

    Quaker meetings function by the service of members on committees. These volunteers handle the routine work of the meeting and prepare business that comes to the entire group for Spirit-led decision making in the Monthly Meeting for Worship with Attention to Business. Everyone is welcome to participate in the work of the meeting.

    When we enter the meeting room, we quietly take our seats on the benches. During the hour or so of worship, anyone who is moved by the Spirit may rise and speak. After an hour, a designated member of the Meeting closes worship with a handshake, which is then shared with all those gathered.

    Absolutely! Children are an important part of our community. We offer care for babies and toddlers downstairs in the Meeting house during the weekly 11 AM Meeting for Worship. For children aged three through high school, we have a First Day School (FDS) program (First Day is a traditional Quaker term for Sunday).

    You might want to come a few minutes before 11 AM to talk to the greeter at the front door about how to find the right class for your child. Most children sit with their parents for the first 15 minutes of Meeting for Worship, and then leave together for their classes next door in the school house building.

    You are welcome to join them for First Day School on your first visit to our Meeting, so you can meet the teachers and see what the class is like, or if it makes your child more comfortable.

    At Chapel Hill Friends Meeting, there are a multitude of options for those who wish to engage in our community beyond simply attending Meeting for Worship. Here are some possibilities:
    September through May, three Sundays per month, the Adult Religious Education committee sponsors forums at 9:45 AM on topics of community interest. [List of Forums](/forums.html).

    On the first Sunday of each month, there is a community potluck after Meeting for Worship. Come join us!

    Attendance at the monthly Meeting for Worship with Attention to Business is an excellent way to experience Quaker ministry in process. Generally held at 9:00 AM on the third Sunday of the month, the [Meeting Calendar](/calendar.html) will provide information about the dates of these important Meetings.

    There are about [16 committees](/committees.html) in our Meeting community, that carry out the work of the Meeting. Nearly all of them are open to anyone with a like-minded interest. List and description of committees.

    Often in the spring, interest groups begin that allow community members to study together, work on a project, or socialize. Topics vary widely, as does the frequency and duration of the group. To be kept up-to-date on such opportunities, subscribe to the listserv by [emailing news@chapelhillfriends.org](mailto:news@chapelhillfriends.org).
