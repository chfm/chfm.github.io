    On Sat. Nov. 23, 10a-12a, Care & Counsel invites you to a threshing session in the Meeting House. We'd love for you to come in person if possible but will gladly welcome you on Zoom as well. The session will deal with the work of our committees, the health and longevity of our committees and possible ways to improve them to both stay current and explore new ideas and directions. Our purpose is not to reach decisions but to generate new input and exchange fresh ideas to energize both individual participation and each committee's interaction with each other.
