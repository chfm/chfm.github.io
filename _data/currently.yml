    We're participating in the 2025 CROP Hunger Walk to support CWS and help families who are struggling with hunger. We're asking you to join us - with your steps and your donations - to provide more meals for the growing number of people in our community who need them, and greater food security in communities around the world. Donating also helps our local IFC food pantry. Please donate to our team today!
